  associated with such tasks for campers as hauling a canoe or other bulky
  gear on the top of a vehicle or in the bed of a truck or trailer.</TT></P>

  
  <P><TT>It is actually a combination of knots that are used to create a
  mechanical advantage in tying down the load. It is assumed that there are
  anchor points such as a rail or eyes which would be at points A and B in
  the illustration.</TT></P>

  
  <P><TT>A variety of knots can be used to accomplish the task. At point
  A for instance the attachment of the line can be accomplished with two
  half hitches or even a bowline loop tied around the anchor point.</TT></P>

  
  <P><TT>The line then proceeds over the load with an inline loop such as
  the Lineman's Loop (Ashley 1053) at point C. A variety of inline loop knots
  will serve as well at this point.</TT></P>

  
  <P><TT>The line then proceeds around or through anchor B and back through
  loop C as illustrated. Pulling on the free end can produce considerable
  tension in the line. Actually care should be exercised so as not to damage
  the load in some instances.</TT></P>

  
  <P><TT>Having achieved the desired tension pinch off the line at D to hold
  the tension.</TT></P>

  
  <P><TT>Work the free end around E in some fashion to secure. This may be
  two half hitches or even a slipped hitch if quick release is desired.</TT></P>

  
  <P><TT>A closed loop knot that serves a similar purpose can be found as
